## What do I do when I'm not coding?

I play Electric Bass, Guitar, and Keyboards and write/record music as a hobby. I've been in an industrial band called Marquee Facade and have a Soundcloud page for my IDM project, [GEIST_COMM](https://soundcloud.com/geistcomm). I'm a recent Warhammer 40k convert and have been learning to paint miniatures.

I take pride in the fact that my personal projects pertain to my interests because it's the most surefire way to stay invested and knowledgable about the subject. I've never been afraid of being an outsider for my interests and if a project is something I'm passionate about, I'll take it over a typical project every time, even if when it's a bigger task.

## What languages do I code in?

## What experience do I have?

**Android Application Engineer** - Zonar Systems - Seattle, WA - _March 2022 - Present_

In this role, I primarily maintain an Android system application for an enterprise system working with proprietary hardware interfacing and GPS tracking. This role requires a high amount of cross-team collaboration with hardware engineers and consuming apps (both internal and external). Additional projects in this role include maintaining libraries for Android and iOS to be used by internal consuming apps and Angular web applications for customer care staff within the company.

**Android Application Engineer, Freelance** - Motorcycle Alert - Riverside, CA - _November 2015 to December 2016_

On this project I worked with the client using an agile methodology to develop as the client gave feedback to the prototypes being presented. I worked on UI/UX, Android development (Java), PHP/MySQL database design and development, and v1.0 release.

**Android Application Developer, Freelance** - Sportronix - Riverside, CA  - _November 2013 to May 2015_

In this role I worked in a team of four developers using an Agile methodology to present our work to the owner and develop as the client gave feedback to the prototypes being presented. I worked primarily on UI/UX and Android development (Java) to complete a v0.1 prototype.

## What projects am I most proud of?

### Tower Climb

###### Languages: **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
###### Software/Technologies: **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **Google Chrome**

[**Tower Climb**](https://github.com/mperez68/Tower_climb) is an extra credit project completed for TCSS 491, Computational Worlds at UW Tacoma. The game is an arcade style tower climbing game where the player guides the character vertically up the screen by jumping on the increasingly scarce platforms generated on the map. The camera pans faster as the game goes on and if the player falls below the moving frame, the game is over and the players score is displayed. The game can be played [here](https://mperez68.github.io/Tower_climb/).

This project was a great way to test out a small scale version of the group project I had been working on in the course. It was an opportunity to plan and execute a more informed design for a browser game and was needed practice for working with the software and capabilities involved. I learned that simplicity can make a great gaming experience; Our main project got bogged down with complications that made it difficult to learn whereas Tower Climb had players intently focused on the games basic premise for a surprising amount of time.

### Wizard Fight

###### Languages: **C#/GDSCript**
###### Software/Technologies: **Godot**

[**Wizard Fight**](https://github.com/mperez68/WizardFight) started as a Unity project but has since been adapted to Godot Engine. The game is a tactical RPG based around cartoon wizards throwing fireballs and lightning bolts. Except some basic spell icons, all assets, including music, were made by me. This project made me realize how much work I need to do on my pixel art but also made me very proud of my music production. The game can be played [here](https://github.com/mperez68/WizardFight/blob/5ade6d3eaece5580d9f5c72d65633402cc8d62d8/Wizard%20Fight.zip).

## What am I working on?

### Untitled Space Shooter

###### Languages: **C#/GDSCript**
###### Software/Technologies: **Godot**

[**Untitled Space Shooter**](https://github.com/mperez68/space_shooter) is a prototype of a movement shooter in low-gravity environments with multiple gravitational bodies. The major question right now is "is it fun or just disorienting?". You can track the project [here](https://github.com/users/mperez68/projects/2).
