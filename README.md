# Marc A. Perez (He/Him), Software Engineer
### University of Washington, Tacoma Campus
B.S. in Computer Science and Systems  
Class of 2021

###### Currently seeking work in Android Applications Development or Front-end Web Development.

## What do I do when I'm not coding?

I play Electric Bass, Guitar, and Keyboards and like to play metal music. I've been in an industrial band called Marquee Facade and have a Soundcloud page for my IDM project, [GEIST_COMM](https://soundcloud.com/geistcomm). As for video games, I like strategy games like Civilization VI and Slay the Spire or platformers like Celeste. Most often, though, I play a lot of Dungeons and Dragons. I've been playing since high school and with the massive amount of new people joining the hobby these past few years, I've become the perma-DM, always relegated to being the one running the show.

I take pride in the fact that my personal projects pertain to my interests because it's the most surefire way to stay invested knowledgable about the subject. I've never been afraid of being an outsider for my interests and if a project is something I'm passionate about, I'll take it over a typical project every time, even if when it's a bigger task.

## What experience do I have?

**Android Application Engineer**

Motorcycle Alert - Riverside, CA  
_November 2015 to December 2016_

###### Software/Technologies: **Android Studio**, **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Adobe Photoshop**, **Google Maps API**, **GoDaddy Web hosting**, **Google Play Store**.

On this project I worked with the client using an agile methodology to develop as the client gave feedback to the prototypes being presented. I worked on UI/UX, Android development (Java), PHP/MySQL database design and development, and V1.0 release.

**Android Application Developer**
Sportronix - Riverside, CA  
_November 2013 to May 2015_

###### Languages: **Java**, **XML**, **MySQL**
###### Software/Technologies: **Android Studio**, **Adobe Photoshop**

In this role I worked in a team of four developers using an Agile methodology to present our work to the owner and develop as the client gave feedback to the prototypes being presented. I worked primarily on UI/UX and Android development (Java).

## What projects am I most proud of?

### Tower Climb

###### Languages: **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
###### Software/Technologies: **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **Google Chrome**

[**Tower Climb**](https://github.com/mperez68/Tower_climb) is an extra credit project completed for TCSS 491, Computational Worlds at UW Tacoma. The game is an arcade style tower climbing game where the player guides the character vertically up the screen by jumping on the increasingly scarce platforms generated on the map. The camera pans faster as the game goes on and if the player falls below the moving frame, the game is over and the players score is displayed. The game can be played [here](https://mperez68.github.io/Tower_climb/).

This project was a great way to test out a small scale version of the group project I had been working on in the course. It was an opportunity to plan and execute a more informed design for a browser game and was needed practice for working with the software and capabilities involved.

### TCSS 450, Mobile Applications Project

###### Languages: **Java**, **Javascript**, **XML**, **HTML**
###### Software/Technologies: **Android Studio**, **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **Postman**, **Pushy**, **Heroku**, **Google Chrome**

The [**Mobile Application Project**](https://github.com/mperez68/Team8TCSS450) for TCSS 450 is a mobile application that does many things. The application has an account creation process that allows you to populate a friends list and access instant messaging with them. The application also presents current weather conditions using the devices GPS features and allowing the user to search for other locations' weather conditions.

The project allowed me to work very intimately with Githubs project board and our team was able to easily coordinate when working remotely and assign tasks as necesary. I was able to work with Node.JS features and architect a database accessed by Node.JS endpoints, which in turn are accessed by the application through the web host. Compared to my previous experiences with PHP and web hosted databases, I had a lot easier time working with Javascript in this project.

### TCSS 360, Software Development and Quality Assurance Techniques Project (Trivia Maze)

[**Trivia Maze**](https://github.com/mperez68/TriviaMaze) is a project for TCSS 360, Software Development and Quality Assurance Techniques that, in itself is very simple. A grid is created in a GUI that can only be traversed by answering historical trivia questions. On a failure, the pathway attempted is locked. If too many doors are locked, the maze becomes unsolvable and the player loses. If the player gets to the goal square, however, the player wins.

This project was a great opportunity to work through creating an SRS, flowchart, and UML before every putting any code down. It was a wonderful example of how much easier a project is when the design is fully fleshed out before beginning and used techniques that I will be using for the rest of my career.

## What am I working on these days?

### Hail Pizza

###### Languages: **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
###### Software/Technologies: **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **MochaJS**, **Adobe Photoshop**, **Google Chrome**

[**Hail Pizza**](https://github.com/mperez68/hail_pizza) is a continuation of a **Browser Game** project for TCSS 491 started in Winter 2021 at UWT. The project is a top-down arcade style action game that is based on the control scheme of [Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_2). The [proof of concept](https://mperez68.github.io/hailpizza/) was delievered for the final project of the course and I have since began personal development of the project to complete the original vision of the game.

The theme of the game is simple: Delivering pizza and blasting heavy metal. The idea came to me at my first job as a pizza delivery driver as I raced around town in my dads red 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse with a trunk full of pizza and speakers blaring my favorite metal bands at full blast. The design of the game is the cartoonish extreme of my old job, pulling inspiration from Ed Roth art to create a chaotic heavy metal atmosphere.

I have two goals for the completion of this project. First, I hope to create a completed technical demo as a complete proof of concept. Secondly, I hope to experiment with front-end technologies such as WebGL and get more experience with Javascript, Node.js, and MochaJS. I intend to port the project into Unity to create a full-fledged game application.

I expect the earliest deliverable of this project to be available by _February 2022_ and complete this project by _April 2022_.

### DM's Friend

###### Languages: **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Javascript**, **XML**, **HTML**
###### Software/Technologies: **Android Studio**, **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **Postman**, **Heroku**, **Google Chrome**

[**DM's Friend**](https://github.com/mperez68/dmsfriend) is an **Android Application** designed for usage by Dungeon Master/Game Master players in the popular tabletop role-playing game, [Dungeons and Dragons, Fifth Edition](https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd).

The application is a running idea of different tools and resources that are useful to have on hand at any given time when running a game of D&D. As someone who has played for over 10 years, I'm using my personal experiences to inform what is necesary to have available at a moments notice such as most common rules, quick search and abbreviated information, and quick generation of non-player characters. My primary design philosophy is to create a UI that uses the fewest number of button presses to get the information you're looking for. The project is currently a framework for retrieving data from a web hosted source with potential to create a companion web application as well.

My primary goal with this project is to experiment with Kotlin and implement it in a small project. In the future, I intend to expand the idea into a full-stack project and port into a web application.

I expect the earliest deliverable of the application to be available in _March 2022_ and complete the application by _May 2022_.
