### Hail Pizza

###### Languages: **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
###### Technologies: **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **MochaJS**, **Google Chrome**

[**Hail Pizza**](https://github.com/mperez68/hail_pizza) is a continuation of a **Browser Game** project for TCSS 491 started in Winter 2021 at UWT. The project is a top-down arcade style action game that is based on the control scheme of [Grand Theft Auto 2 (1999)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_2). The [proof of concept](https://mperez68.github.io/hailpizza/) was delievered for the final project of the course and I have since began personal development of the project to complete the original vision of the game.

The theme of the game is simple: Delivering pizza and blasting heavy metal. The idea came to me at my first job as a pizza delivery driver as I raced around town in my dads red 2000 Mitsubishi Eclipse with a trunk full of pizza and speakers blaring Fear Factory, Ministry, and Godflesh at full blast. Put simply, the design of the game is the cartoonish extreme of my old job, pulling inspiration from Ed Roth art.

I have two goals for the completion of this project. First, I hope to create a completed technical demo as a complete proof of concept. Secondly, I hope to experiment with front-end technologies such as WebGL and get more experience with Javascript, Node.js, and MochaJS. I intend to port the project into Unity to create a full-fledged game application.

I expect the earliest deliverable of this revamped project to be available by _February 2022_ and will be iterating further from there.

### DM's Friend

###### Languages: **Java**, **Kotlin**, **Javascript**, **XML**, **HTML**
###### Technologies: **Android Studio**, **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **MochaJS**, **Postman**, **Heroku**, **Google Chrome**

[**DM's Friend**](https://github.com/mperez68/dmsfriend) is an **Android Application** designed for usage by Dungeon Master/Game Master players in the popular tabletop role-playing game, [Dungeons and Dragons, Fifth Edition](https://dnd.wizards.com/dungeons-and-dragons/what-is-dd).

The application is a running idea of different tools and resources that are useful to have on hand at any given time when running a game of D&D. As someone who has played for over 10 years, I'm using my personal experiences to inform what is necesary to have available at a moments notice such as most common rules, quick search and abbreviated information, and quick generation of non-player characters. My primary design philosophy is to create a UI that uses the fewest number of button presses to get the information you're looking for. The project is currently a framework for retrieving data from a web hosted source with potential to create a companion web application as well.

My primary goal with this project is to experiment with Kotlin and implement it in a small project. In the future, I intend to expand the idea unto a full-stack project and create a web application that does as much of the same functions as is reasonable to port.

I expect the earliest deliverable of the application to be available in _March 2022_.
