## What projects am I most proud of?

### Tower Climb

###### Languages: **Javascript**, **HTML**, **CSS**
###### Software/Technologies: **Microsoft Visual Studio Code**, **Node.js**, **Google Chrome**

[**Tower Climb**](https://github.com/mperez68/Tower_climb) is an extra credit project completed for TCSS 491, Computational Worlds at UW Tacoma. The game is an arcade style tower climbing game where the player guides the character vertically up the screen by jumping on the increasingly scarce platforms generated on the map. The camera pans faster as the game goes on and if the player falls below the moving frame, the game is over and the players score is displayed. The game can be played [here](https://mperez68.github.io/Tower_climb/).

This project was a great way to test out a small scale version of the group project I had been working on in the course. It was an opportunity to plan and execute a more informed design for a browser game and was needed practice for working with the software and capabilities involved. I learned that simplicity can make a great gaming experience; Our main project got bogged down with complications that made it difficult to learn whereas Tower Climb had players intently focused on the games basic premise for a surprising amount of time.

### Wizard Fight

###### Languages: **C#/GDSCript**
###### Software/Technologies: **Godot**

My first completed video game project, [**Wizard Fight**](https://github.com/mperez68/WizardFight) started as a Unity project but has since been adapted to Godot Engine. The game is a tactical RPG based around cartoon wizards throwing fireballs and lightning bolts. Except some basic spell icons, all assets, including music, were made by me. This project made me realize how much work I need to do on my pixel art but also made me very proud of my music production. The game can be played [here](https://github.com/mperez68/WizardFight/blob/5ade6d3eaece5580d9f5c72d65633402cc8d62d8/Wizard%20Fight.zip).
